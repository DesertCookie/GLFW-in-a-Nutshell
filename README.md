# Getting Started

## What is GLFW?

GLFW is short for Graphics Library Framework. It provides a simple API for creating and handling windows and contexts, and receiving input. The project is open source and supports all major operating systems. It has buit-in support for industry standard rendering APIs like OpenGL and Vulkan, and can be used in virtually any programming language, thanks to more than thirty open source bindings.

More information about GLFW can be found on \[glfw.org\]\([https:/](https://www.glfw.org/)[glfw.org/](https://www.glfw.org/)\). The website houses an active \[forum\]\([http://discourse.glfw.org/](http://discourse.glfw.org/)\), as well as superb \[documentation\]\([https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/)\). Examples and source code of GLFW can be found in the official \[GitHub repository\]\([https://github.com/glfw/glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)\).

## Setting up a Project

### Java

There are several bindings available for Java. Most notably \[jGLFW\]\([https://github.com/badlogic/jglfw](https://github.com/badlogic/jglfw)\) by badlogic, and \[LWJGL-GLFW\]\([https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/0899574031d87639702dcbdce5be89c10df02a27/modules/lwjgl/glfw](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/tree/0899574031d87639702dcbdce5be89c10df02a27/modules/lwjgl/glfw)\), part of the Lightweigh Java Gaming Library.  
Throughout this guide, the latter binding will be used.
